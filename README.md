# peruggia

A cli tool for extracting calendar events from Fantasy Grounds.

Peruggia searches the default path (mac) for a given campaign and copies the calendar entries to markdown files.

## Install and Run

### Local Install

If you're familiar with Node you could clone this repo and run this cli tool in place.

`node src/index.mjs`

### Global Install

Alternatively you could install this repo globally...

`npm i -g https://github.com/jkrayer/peruggia.git`

...and run from the command line anywhere at all.

`peruggia`

## Options

Peruggia asks two simple questions.

1.  What campaign do you want to copy the calendar from?
2.  Where do you want to write the files to.

Simply anwer these and you're done.

## And a Whole Lot More...

Peruggia has the potential to do a whole lot more but for the moment at least it suits my needs. If you find this repo and wish to use it but it doesn't quite do what you need feel free to [log an issue](https://github.com/jkrayer/peruggia/issues) and I'll be happy to help.

_(Vincent Peruggia famously stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911.)_
